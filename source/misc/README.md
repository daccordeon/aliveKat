#aliveKat/source/misc/

miscellaneous code from learning tasks set during the initial stage of the project
this code is **not** relevant to replicating the results in the report and is here simply as evidence of work done during the project
this code is lightly documented and not intended for general use, explore it if you wish

- ex2-3_optical_cavity_matrix.nb was used while solving for the empty linear cavity fields
- task3_average_power_fluctuation.nb was used while learning material about laser and vacuum noise
- readout_task.nb was used while learning material about readout schemes
- simple_squeezer.nb contains the analytics for the PSD of the homodyne intensity of squeezed light coming from a squeezer alone (without any cavity, just squeezing vacuum)
- learning_finesse.ipynb was the workspace used while going through Sections 1 and 2 of the tutorials on [gwoptics.](http://www.gwoptics.org/learn/index.html)
