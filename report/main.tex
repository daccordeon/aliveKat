% single paragraph, short sales pitch

Gravitational wave detectors are highly complex and the analytics describing them is difficult to derive and impossible to do without idealisations. Optical modelling allows the researcher to quickly ascertain the efficacy of a proposed configuration, including realistic effects, without needing to derive the analytics. We demonstrate this using Finesse~\cite{finesse} by modelling a configuration of Advanced LIGO~\cite{AdvancedLIGO:2015} that has a long signal recycling cavity with a degenerate squeezer inside. We first test the already implemented squeezer component in a squeezed cavity against analytics we derive. We then test the proposed configuration against existing analytics (derived elsewhere) and show that the model works up to a $5\%$ fractional error when corrections are made for the different conventions used. Finally, we optimise the high frequency (kHz) peak quantum noise limited sensitivity of the proposed configuration by varying the squeezer parameters to show the benefits of the design.

% gw’s and gw detectors
The first direct detection of gravitational waves in 2015 from the merger of two black holes~\cite{GW150914} opened a new frontier for astronomy. 
Gravitational waves are a prediction of the theory of General Relativity and represent ripples in the ``fabric of space-time'' that stretch and squash the lengths and durations between events. Gravitational wave detectors, including the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (henceforth called aLIGO~\cite{AdvancedLIGO:2015}), are vast and complex experiments that rely fundamentally on the interference of light to detect minuscule changes in the lengths of the arms of an interferometer kilometres long, such as those shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:gw_ifos}. Currently, detectable gravitational waves are limited to come from transient, massive cosmic sources, such as the binary mergers of black holes and neutron stars~\cite{GWTC-1:2018}. With the initial generation of detectors having demonstrated that detection is possible, the natural question now is how to improve upon them to make detectors with higher sensitivity for all kinds of sources.
Possible future sources include continuous gravitational waves from rotating neutron stars~\cite{SuvorovaEtAl:2016}, early universe observations, and higher frequency signals such as those emitted during the late stages of binary neutron star-neutron star mergers.
It is the latter of these sources that concerns us here and so forms our goal of improving the high frequency (kHz) sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors.


% motivate the need for optical modelling
Due to the complexity of the detectors, deriving analytic solutions for the expected signal and noise output due to a passing gravitational wave is difficult to do, and is impossible if we want to include many realistic effects. %, and almost never into a closed form. 
While solutions are known for the current configurations, with each new proposed configuration a new set of non-trivial analytics needs to be derived, and as the proposals get more exotic this task only becomes more tedious.
One solution is to use optical modelling tools that can deliver fast results and let the researcher quickly ascertain the efficacy of a proposed configuration. These optical models also allow the researcher to diagnose the cause of errors in a given detector by selectively including different physical effects.


% what we do
In this report, we demonstrate the use of the optical modelling software Finesse~\cite{finesse}, for a variety of gravitational wave detector configurations and compare against known analytics. In particular, we test the implementation of a non-linear element, a squeezer crystal, in Finesse.
We test this component first in a simple cavity and compare its results with analytics we derive. We then test it in a proposed detector configuration with a squeezer inside of a long signal recycling cavity (SRC), this configuration is called ``internal squeezing''.
Current gravitational wave detectors only use a squeezer externally to the interferometer and inject in the squeezed states.
At high frequencies, these detectors are limited by quantum noise, in particular, shot noise. Internal squeezing is predicted to improve the quantum noise limited (strain) sensitivity around the coupled cavity pole above the current detectors, without increasing the circulating power in the arms nor affecting the low frequency sensitivity of the detector~\cite{Korobko_2019,Adya_2020}.
By testing internal squeezing in Finesse we can attempt to verify these claims, but first, we must demonstrate that we can trust the new implementation of a non-linear element to simulate squeezing accurately.


% report structure
This report is structured as follows.
In Section~\ref{sec:Finesse} we detail Finesse and what it does.
In Sections~\ref{sec:basics} and~\ref{sec:squeezing} we review the basics of optics for interferometry and squeezing, respectively. In Section~\ref{sec:gwIFO} we review the Michelson interferometer and detail the configuration of aLIGO.

\section{Finesse} %- Optical modelling
\label{sec:Finesse}
% this section can be quite short

% what does finesse do, how does it do it
Finesse~\cite{finesse} (Frequency domain INterfErometer Simulation SoftwarE) is designed to model optical configurations such as gravitational wave interferometers (see Section~\ref{sec:gwIFO}). Given a configuration of optical components, it calculates the complex amplitudes for the carrier, any control signals, the signal sidebands from mirror motion (such as from a gravitational wave), and the quantum noise sidebands (see Section~\ref{sec:basics}) at each connecting node. By solving the appropriate matrix equations, it works in the frequency domain and the steady-state regime.
Finesse can calculate the quantum noise at the output and the signal transfer function, and therefore the sensitivity of a proposed detector configuration, which is what we are interested in modelling (see Section~\ref{sec:aLIGOcomparison}). Finesse is actively used for gravitational wave detector commissioning~\cite{brown2020pykat} and outside gravitational wave research for modelling optical cavities.


Although not explored here, Finesse is also able to handle physical effects such as spatial geometry using Gaussian beams, noise coupling from different parts of the interferometer, imperfections on mirror surfaces, optical misalignment, and higher order modes~\cite{Bond_et_al_2016}.
Handling these realistic effects analytically quickly becomes tedious and time consuming, with increasing complexity for each effect included. As such, Finesse facilitates a faster workflow for modelling realistic configurations.
% The inclusion of such physical effects means that it can better model and diagnose experiments than analytic solutions, as the analytics often assume some greater level of idealisation of the interferometer.


% what is new
Newly implemented in Finesse is a non-linear element component (henceforth called \code{nle}) that simulates a squeezer crystal (see Section~\ref{sec:squeezing}). The modelling of this component was based on similar analytics to those in Appendix~\ref{app:squeezed_cavity_analytics}. Unlike the older existing squeezer component (\code{sq}) in Finesse, the \code{nle} can be placed anywhere within the configuration. This allows us to model the internal squeezing configuration detailed in Section~\ref{sec:gwIFO}. We are interested in testing both whether this component is implemented correctly and in using it to examine proposed detector configurations with internal squeezing. Although, applications of the \code{nle} are not limited to gravitational wave detector modelling.


% how we use it
We interact with the simulation through a Python~\cite{python} wrapper called PyKat~\cite{brown2020pykat}, in particular, this allows for optimisation routines and plotting in Python to find optimal configurations for a detector. All of our work is documented and available as open-source software at \url{https://github.com/daccordeon/aliveKat}.

\section{Basics of optics for interferometry}
\label{sec:basics}

\subsection{Modulation}
% one paragraph
% phase modulation produces sidebands, mirror motion causes phase modulation

The light in a gravitational wave interferometer consists of a carrier at around $\omega_0 \approx 1.8 \times 10^{15}$~(rad)~Hz, control and local oscillators at MHz, and noise from classical and quantum sources across the detection band. Detectable gravitational waves are found with frequencies between Hz and $10$ kHz. When a gravitational wave passes through the interferometer its effect of stretching or squashing space is akin to the end mirrors in the arms moving back and forth. A moving mirror phase modulates the light incident on it. In the time domain, for a simple sinusoidal carrier $A \cos(\omega_0 t)$ with amplitude $A$ incident on a mirror undergoing small sinusoidal motion at some frequency $\Omega \ll \omega_0$, the reflected light has amplitude $A \cos(\omega_0 t + \delta_m \cos(\Omega t + \phi_m))$ where $\delta_m$ is the modulation depth and $\phi_m$ is the relative phase.


Given a strain $\abs{h(t)} \approx 10^{-22}$ from a gravitational wave and an arm length $L \approx 10^3$~m the scale of the change in distance is $\abs{\Delta L} = \abs{L h(t)} \approx 10^{-19}$ m, far smaller than the radius of a proton ($10^{-15}$ m) and the wavelength of the carrier $\lambda_0 = 1.064 \times 10^{-6}$ m. This means that the modulation is ``weak'' and we can take a Taylor expansion in terms of a small modulation depth given by
\begin{equation}
\abs{\delta_m} = \abs{\frac{2 \omega_0 L h}{c}} = \abs{\frac{4 \pi \Delta L}{\lambda_0}} \ll 1
\end{equation}


In the frequency domain, taking a Taylor expansion in terms of the small modulation depth, the modulation appears as sidebands at $\omega_0 \pm \Omega$, at phase $\pi/2$ ahead of the carrier and with amplitude proportional to the modulation depth.
Weak amplitude modulation of the form $A (1 + \delta_m \cos(\Omega t + \phi_m)) \cos(\omega_0 t)$, not considered in-depth here, similarly results in faint sidebands at $\omega_0 \pm \Omega$ but in phase with the carrier.


Gravitational waves, therefore, create weak signal sidebands in the arms of the interferometer. Noise sources (including quantum noise which we consider here) can also shake the mirrors and create sidebands of comparable magnitude in the same frequency range. Moreover, noise sources can appear as sidebands similar to the gravitational wave signal through other processes than moving the mirrors. Measuring the signal sidebands despite the noise is the role of the rest of the detector, see Section~\ref{sec:squeezing}.


\subsection{Types of optical cavities}
% one paragraph
% interference of reflected field and circulating field
% Coupled, overcoupled, undercoupled

\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[height=0.45\textwidth, angle=-90]{figures/cavity_fsr_fwhm_finesse.pdf}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Circulating power in an overcoupled cavity relative to incident power, calculated by analytics. The cavity is of length 1 m and has reflectivities $r_1 = 0.9^{\frac{1}{2}}$ and $r_2 = 1$ for the front and back mirrors, respectively, which are assumed to be lossless. This figure shows the free spectral range (FSR), full-width at half-maximum (FWHM), and finesse of the cavity.}
	\label{fig:cavity_fsr_fwhm_finesse}
\end{figure}

In gravitational wave detectors, many cavities are used to perform a variety of functions (see Section~\ref{sec:gwIFO}). Any cavity is equivalent to a two mirror cavity. Consider a linear Fabry-Peroy cavity: two lossless mirrors with reflectivities $r_1$ and $r_2$ separated by a space of macroscopic length $N \lambda_0$, where $N \in \mathbb{N}$ and $\lambda_0$ is the wavelength of the carrier light. Meaning that the length is tuned to resonate at the wavelength $\lambda_0$. Of the light incident on the front mirror from outside the cavity, $\abs{r_1}^2$ of the power is reflected promptly and undergoes no phase change (using the convention of no phase change on reflection and $\pi/2$ on transmission). The light that enters the cavity will either continue to circulate or eventually leave through one of the mirrors. The circulating light that eventually leaks back out through the front mirror has undergone a phase change of $\pi$ relative to the promptly reflected light and so will destructively interfere with that light. The result of this is that the power ratio of the incident to the reflected light, working in the frequency domain, is given by~\cite{Danilishin_2012}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:refl_field_amp}
\abs{\frac{E_{\mathrm{refl}}}{E_{\mathrm{inci}}}}^2 = \abs{\frac{r_1 - r_2 e^{-i 2 (\psi + \frac{\Omega L}{c})}}{1- r_1 r_2 e^{-i 2 (\psi + \frac{\Omega L}{c})}}}^2.
\end{equation}
Where we have allowed for the cavity to have tuning $\psi = \frac{\omega_0 \delta l}{c}$ for some microscopic length $\delta l$ and for the light to be at some angular frequency offset $\Omega$ from the carrier at $\omega_0$, and we assumed that both of these quantities are small such that $\frac{\Omega \delta l}{c} \ll 1$.

Fabry-Peroy cavities fall into three categories determined by which of the two reflected fields dominate the destructive interference mentioned above, which depends on the relative size of $r_1$ and $r_2$. If $r_1 = r_2$, then the cavity is impedance matched, the fields exactly balance and no light is reflected back (see Eq.~\ref{eq:refl_field_amp}). If $r_1 < r_2$, then the cavity is overcoupled, the transmitted circulating field wins out and light is reflected off the cavity. And, if $r_1 > r_2$, then the cavity is undercoupled, the directly reflected field wins out and the light is reflected at a $\pi$ phase shift relative to the overcoupled case. In gravitational wave detectors, both overcoupled cavities (e.g.\ the arm cavities) and impedance matched cavities (e.g.\ the power recycling cavity, when no reflection is necessary) are used.


If the reflectivities are fixed and instead the frequency of the incoming light is changed, then resonance peaks are seen in the power of the circulating field whenever the round-trip distance is some multiple of the wavelength. The distance between these peaks, the free spectral range (FSR), is given by
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{FSR} = \frac{c}{2L}.
\end{equation}
Comparing this to the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of each peak (also known as the linewidth) gives a dimensionless rating for the cavity that allows for different cavities to be compared, known as the finesse
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{finesse} = \frac{\mathrm{FSR}}{\mathrm{FWHM}}.
\end{equation}
The finesse is analogous to the quality factor of a mechanical oscillator.
The FSR, FWHM, and finesse of an example overcoupled cavity are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cavity_fsr_fwhm_finesse}.
For reference, the aLIGO arm cavities have a finesse of $440$~\cite{AdvancedLIGO:2015} compared to the finesse of $9.5$ shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cavity_fsr_fwhm_finesse}.

	\label{fig:ball_and_stick_squeezed_state}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Squeezed states}
% one paragraph

Given a sinusoidal signal of frequency $\Omega$, one can decompose it into two quadratures $A_C \cos(\Omega t) + A_S \sin(\Omega t)$, called the cosine and sine or the amplitude and phase quadratures (so called because of effects of amplitude and phase modulation are seen in their respective quadratures). Note that the quadrature decomposition of all the light in the interferometer is relative and taken (typically) with respect to the carrier.


We are interested in quadratures because they lead to a simple explanation of squeezing. In the quantum mechanical two-photon formalism~\cite{Danilishin_2012}, the quadratures relate the harmonic oscillator creation/annihilation operators of the sidebands ($\hat{a}_{\omega_0 \pm \Omega}^\dagger, \hat{a}_{\omega_0 \pm \Omega}$) around the carrier. Assuming that $\Omega \ll \omega_0$, these are related by
\begin{align}
\hat{a}_c(\Omega) &\approx \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (\hat{a}_{\omega_0 + \Omega} + \hat{a}_{\omega_0 - \Omega}^\dagger),\\
\hat{a}_s(\Omega) &\approx \frac{1}{i \sqrt{2}} (\hat{a}_{\omega_0 + \Omega} - \hat{a}_{\omega_0 - \Omega}^\dagger).
\end{align}
In quantum optics, these then define dimensionless “position” and “momentum” operators $\hat{X}, \hat{Y}$, the moments of which describe the uncertainty in each quadrature (and are also equal to values in the spectral density and covariance matrices~\cite{Danilishin_2012}). These uncertainties are equivalent to uncertainty in the amplitude and phase of the electric field.


Consider a vacuum state, although the expected value for either quadrature is zero $\langle \hat{X} \rangle = \langle \hat{Y} \rangle = 0$, due to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (HUP) the standard deviations are limited by $\mathrm{Var}[\hat{X}]^{\frac{1}{2}} \mathrm{Var}[\hat{Y}]^{\frac{1}{2}} \geq \frac{1}{2}$. Imagining the distribution of the state in $X \times Y$ phase space, this means that smallest area the noise ellipse corresponding to one standard deviation can have is $\frac{1}{2}$. The noise ellipse of the vacuum ground state with minimum uncertainty has equal radii of $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$.


Squeezing a state scales one quadrature variance down by some factor while scaling the other quadrature variance up by the same factor, to maintain the HUP. In phase space, this looks like “squeezing” the noise circle: one of its radii decreases and the other increases such that its area remains the same, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ball_and_stick_squeezed_state}. A squeezer is defined by two parameters, the squeezing strength $r_{\mathrm{dB}} = 20 \log_{10}(e^r)$ and the squeezing angle $\phi_{\mathrm{sqz}}$. The squeezing strength measures, in dB, the gain in the squeezed quadrature. For a squeezed (vacuum) state the radii get scaled to $\frac{e^{\pm r}}{\sqrt{2}}$. The squeezing angle determines along which line the noise ellipse is squeezed.

\subsubsection{Spectral density}

% spectral density of the quantum noise
The goal of squeezing in a gravitational wave interferometer is primarily to control the quantum noise in a given quadrature. By squeezing the vacuum input (see Section~\ref{sec:gwIFO}) we change the spectrum of the quantum noise, reducing the noise in one quadrature while worsening it in the other. The (double-sided) power spectral density (PSD) $\hat{S}_Z$ of the quantum noise $\hat{Z}$, given a spectrum $\hat{Z}(\Omega)$, is given by
\begin{equation}
\hat{S}_Z(\Omega) 2 \pi \delta(\Omega - \Omega') = \langle0| \hat{Z}(\Omega) \circ \hat{Z}^\dagger(\Omega') |0\rangle
\end{equation}
where $|0\rangle$ is the vacuum state and $\circ$ is the symmetric product $A \circ B = \frac{1}{2}(A B + B A)$.
The spectral density of the light is what we eventually measure to inspect the sidebands therein.
Note that the convention for strain sensitivity uses amplitude spectral density (ASD), e.g.\ lossless 6 dB of injected external squeezing improves the quantum noise limited sensitivity measured as ASD by a factor of 2~\cite{Aasi_2013}.
Therefore, the convention for decibels (dB) is defined as $20 \log_{10}(Q/{Q(0)})$ for some quantity $Q$, e.g.\ the quantum noise limited sensitivity. The choice of this convention is noteworthy as it will cause the appearance of apparent factors of two in cases where dB is defined as $10 \log_{10}(Q/{Q(0)})$.

\subsection{Generation of squeezed states}

\begin{figure}[ht]%

This figure shows that the gain from the \code{nle} is a factor of two more than \code{sq}.}%
    \label{fig:testing_Finesse_squeezers}%
\end{figure}

In the laboratory or a gravitational wave detector like aLIGO, squeezed states are generated in a non-linear crystal in which parametric down conversion (PDC) occurs stimulated by a pump laser. In degenerate squeezing, a photon of pump frequency $2\omega_0$ is annihilated and two photons of frequency $\omega_0$ are created (called the signal and the idler).
Assuming that the pump propagates through the crystal in one direction, then squeezing occurs only in that direction, and any light or vacuum passing through the crystal in the opposite direction is unaffected. Assuming that this is the case, we then call the non-linear crystal ``directional''.
% The non-linear crystal is designed to be directional in that squeezing occurs if the light passes in one direction through the crystal but in the other direction the light is unaffected.
The relative phase between the pump and the carrier determines the squeezer angle.
% and the power of the pump determines the squeezer power?


In the analytics used here, squeezing is performed by suitable multiplication of the quadrature amplitudes by a squeezing matrix (see Appendix~\ref{app:squeezed_cavity_analytics}). Given a squeezer parameter $r$ as input, the squeezing strength (or, the amount of signal gain) in dB is given by $r_{\mathrm{dB}} = 20 \log_{10}(e^r)$. The analytics also accounts for the directionality of the squeezer crystal.


In the non-linear element (\code{nle}) implementation in Finesse, squeezing is performed by similar quadrature manipulation as the analytics. Given a gain value in dB as input, the \code{nle} will produce twice that amount of squeezing as output. In other words, the \code{nle} treats the dB input as $10 \log_{10} (e^r)$ (a power quantity) instead of $20 \log_{10} (e^r)$ (an amplitude quantity) as in the convention mentioned above. This can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:testing_Finesse_squeezers}, the right panel displays the \code{nle} while the left panel displays the other, external squeezer component (\code{sq}) which behaves conventionally. Additionally, the \code{nle} will squeeze states incident from either side as is directionless. These differences will be apparent in the results shown (see Sections~\ref{sec:sqzcavity} and~\ref{sec:aLIGOcomparison}).


\subsection{Homodyne readout}
\label{sec:homodyne}
% one paragraph

To detect the faint signal sidebands we use a readout scheme at the output of the interferometer.
One way to amplify the sidebands is to beat them against a strong local oscillator provided by another laser. Adding another laser, however, introduces additional noise in the form of fluctuations in the laser light. To remove this additional laser noise, we need two detectors with suitable relative phase such that we can subtract the noise from the second laser.


In balanced homodyne readout, the output signal is mixed with a strong local oscillator at a $50/50$ beamsplitter. The local oscillator comes from a second laser at the carrier frequency $\omega_0$ but with some relative phase to the carrier, called the homodyne angle $\phi_{\mathrm{LO}}$. After the beamsplitter, the two mixed beams, with different relative phases between the signal and local oscillator, are each read by a photodiode.
The resultant homodyne current is proportional to the difference in intensities at the photodiodes.
Homodyne readout in a simplified aLIGO configuration is shown inside the dashed blue box in Fig.~\ref{fig:aLIGO_configuration}.


The homodyne current is proportional to the amplitude of the local oscillator times a combination of the sideband quadrature amplitudes dependent on $\phi_{\mathrm{LO}}$. It is independent of any laser noise from the second laser by subtracting the intensities at the photodiodes. Additionally, appropriate choice of $\phi_{\mathrm{LO}}$ allows the squeezed quadrature to be extracted. Note that homodyne readout does nothing to reduce the noise already present in the sidebands, it just allows for the benefits of squeezing to be gained by filtering out the anti-squeezed (or worsened) quadrature.

\subsection{The Michelson interferometer}
% one paragraph

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[height=0.35\textwidth, angle=-90]{figures/Michelson_interferometer.pdf}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Configuration of a simple Michelson interferometer. A laser beam is split down two arms by a beamsplitter, reflects off a mirror at the end of each arm, and then interferes back at the beamsplitter. At the output of the beamsplitter is a photodiode to detect any amplitude modulation there due to phase modulation in the arms (e.g.\ due to mirror motion).}
	\label{fig:Michelson}
\end{figure}

In its simplest form, a Michelson interferometer consists of a laser, a beamsplitter, two arm mirrors, and a photodiode. The laser light is split and travels down two perpendicular arms, reflects off a mirror at the end of each arm, and then recombines at the beamsplitter output, at which a photodiode is placed. The differential length of the two arms produces interference at the beamsplitter.
If something perturbs the mirrors (e.g.\ a gravitational wave or some noise) and creates phase modulation of the carrier in the arms (see Section~\ref{sec:basics}), then the interference at the beamsplitter converts that modulation to amplitude modulation, which can be detected at the photodiode.
Note that we are ignoring all spatial effects henceforth.


By tuning the unperturbed lengths of the arms, the output of the beamsplitter can be made such that, by default, no carrier is present. This is known as setting the output to the dark-port or as setting the operating point of the interferometer to a dark fringe. In practice, the operating point is set slightly off the dark fringe to use a different readout scheme (DC readout), but, for balanced homodyne readout, being exactly at the dark fringe is ideal.
% to balance the response to the differential length change and the amplitude of the sidebands.


In the far-field, a gravitational wave stretches and squashes the distances between objects in a quadrupole manner. Transverse to the axis of propagation, distances in one direction are stretched while those in the perpendicular direction are squashed. To best detect these changes we need two pairs of objects at right angles to each other (and, ideally, to the gravitational wave). These pairs consist of each mirror and the beamsplitter.


\subsection{Configuration of aLIGO}

Building on the Michelson interferometer in Fig.~\ref{fig:Michelson}, this configuration adds in arm cavities (between ITM and ETM), a power recycling mirror (PRM), and a signal recycling mirror (SRM) all to improve the sensitivity of the detector by increasing the power in the arms or the time that the signal spends there.

We study a simplified configuration of aLIGO, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:aLIGO_configuration}, and motivate each additional component.


% arm cavities, prc, src, 
To achieve the sensitivity required for gravitational wave detection, a classical Michelson interferometer requires large amounts of power in the arms to reduce the shot noise (see Section~\ref{sec:noise_sources}) and arm lengths tens of kilometres long to be optimally sensitive.
Smaller detectors which require less power can be built be by increasing the effective arm length by increasing the storage time in the arms and by making the light experience the gravitational wave strain for longer. This can be achieved by introducing another mirror into each of the beam arms, forming an overcoupled arm cavity between an initial test mass (ITM) mirror and an end test mass (ETM) mirror. In aLIGO, each of these masses is 40 kg heavy and made of fused silica~\cite{AdvancedLIGO:2015}. The arm cavities in aLIGO are constructed to increase the number of times the average photon circulates the cavity by having a high finesse of $440$ (see Section~\ref{sec:basics}).


To further increase the power in the arms, a power recycling mirror (PRM) is introduced before the beamsplitter. This reflects power returning from the arm cavities back into the interferometer. For reference, currently~\cite{Buikema_2020} in aLIGO a $35$ W main laser results in approximately $1.6$ kW of power incident on the beamsplitter and $200$ kW of power in the arms, due to the arm cavities and the PRM. At the ``design power'' level, aLIGO would have a $125$ W input laser, $5.2$ kW incident on the beamsplitter, and $750$ kW of power in the arms.


It is beneficial for the beam arms to be kilometres long (e.g.\ $4$ km long in aLIGO) for the effective length to be closer to the optimal length for gravitational wave detection. To increase sensitivity, the signal from the dark-port of the beamsplitter can be amplified by reflecting it back into the arms to ``see'' the gravitational wave again. This is done by placing a signal recycling mirror (SRM) after the dark-port of the beamsplitter. The effect of the signal recycling cavity (SRC) is more complicated than this and is detailed further in Section~\ref{sec:long_srcs}.


\subsubsection{Reduction of aLIGO to coupled cavities}
% simplification to coupled cavities

	\caption{Reduced configuration of aLIGO from that shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:aLIGO_configuration} to two coupled cavities representing the SRC and the arm “cavity”. This reduction holds to a good approximation. The benefit of the reduction is to explain how the signal and the vacuum fluctuations see the non-linear element differently, namely, that they enter from different sides of the interferometer.}
	\label{fig:aLIGO_as_coupled_cavities}
\end{figure}

Despite all the components in the (simplified) aLIGO configuration, the resultant transfer functions for the signal and the noise are equivalent (to a good approximation) to those for two coupled cavities, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:aLIGO_as_coupled_cavities}. The differential mode from the two arms becomes an optomechanical coupling between the SRC and the beam arm under this equivalence.
Although the coupled cavity system is not physical, for example, the source of the laser in the arm cavity is not physical, the reduction is useful to understanding the interferometer. In particular, it is clear in the reduced system that the signal and the vacuum fluctuations see the cavities differently as they enter from different sides. This explains how internal squeezing can affect them differently, as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:internal_squeezing}.


\subsection{Noise sources}
\label{sec:noise_sources}
% strain plot, quantum noise limited sensitivity
% quantum, Newtonian (seismic), thermal,

\begin{figure*}[ht]%
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{figures/sqz_aLIGO_analytics_quantum_noise_budget-labelled.pdf}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Quantum noise limited sensitivity of aLIGO (shown without any squeezing). This figure was generated using existing analytics. This figure shows the regions where the radiation pressure (blue) or the shot noise (pink) dominates, along with the standard quantum limit (SQL) where they balance. At high frequencies, the shot noise dominates and we aim to reduce it via internal squeezing.}
	\label{fig:sqz_aLIGO_analytics_quantum_noise_budget}
\end{figure*}


In aLIGO, noise enters the system from many sources and reduces sensitivity across the frequency range of Hz to kHz. Classically, these include (but are not limited to) vibrations in the ground (seismic noise), changes in the nearby distribution of matter (known as Newtonian noise), thermal vibration of the components and the systems that hold them (thermal noise), and fluctuations in the frequency, amplitude, and shape of the main laser beam (laser noise). Control systems and the natural resonances of the mirror suspensions also remove the possibility for detection in certain bands. We do not consider these effects here, instead, we focus on the quantum noise which limits the high frequency sensitivity. We assume that all these noise sources are static in frequency (an often reasonable assumption).


Quantum noise comes from the fundamental HUP limits on the uncertainty in each quadrature, discussed in Section~\ref{sec:squeezing}. Vacuum enters the interferometer at every open port, most importantly from behind the SRM, and, due to the Fluctuation Dissipation Theorem~\cite{Danilishin_2012}, at every lossy optical component in the form of new, uncorrelated noise. In the phase quadrature, quantum noise manifests as shot noise, uncertainty in the number of photons hitting one of the mirrors. Shot noise is approximately constant across the detection band, but the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), due to the finite bandwidth of the arm cavities, rolls off at higher frequencies, where we say that the shot noise dominates. In the amplitude quadrature, quantum noise comes as radiation pressure, the momentum of incident light driving mirror oscillations, that is strongest at low frequencies. Increasing the power in the arms increases radiation pressure but reduces favourably shot noise, leading to a trade-off in how much power is put into the interferometer.


To compare the effect of noise sources on the detector’s ability to detect gravitational waves, we define the noise limited strain sensitivity to be the signal amplitude required to achieve an SNR of one, with respect to the given noise source in isolation. This means computing the noise at the output and the signal transfer function for the interferometer and suitably dividing them. The total sensitivity of the interferometer is the SNR with respect to the total noise, equal to the root sum squared of the contribution from each noise source, e.g.\
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{total\; noise = \sqrt{(quantum \; noise)^2 + (thermal \; noise)^2 + \ldots}}
\end{equation}
In frequency, the maximum sensitivity with respect to the quantum noise is achieved where the radiation pressure and shot noise balance, known as the standard quantum limit (SQL), shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:sqz_aLIGO_analytics_quantum_noise_budget}. Recall from Section~\ref{sec:introduction} that current gravitational wave detectors are limited at high frequencies by shot noise and so the improvement of high frequency quantum noise limited sensitivity is what we are aiming to demonstrate.


\subsection{Short versus long signal recycling cavities}
\label{sec:long_srcs}

\begin{figure*}
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{figures/aLIGO_transfer_fns_and_sensitivity_comparison.pdf}

	\caption{The quantum noise (top panel), signal transfer function (middle panel), and quantum noise limited sensitivity (bottom panel) for aLIGO. This figure shows the results from a model in Finesse for different lengths of SRC (53 m and 2000 m) and with and without internal squeezing. The detectors in Finesse (\code{qhd} and \code{hd}) measure amplitude spectral density (ASD). This figure shows that increasing the length of the SRC increases the peak sensitivity at the coupled cavity pole, decreases the bandwidth after the coupled cavity pole, and changes the frequency band squeezed by the non-linear element. Internal squeezing reduces the quantum noise in a high frequency band, de-amplifies the signal, and results in greater peak sensitivity around the coupled cavity pole. No change is seen in any case at low frequencies.}
	\label{fig:src_transfer_functions}
\end{figure*}

The signal recycling cavity (SRC) amplifies the gravitational wave signal by reflecting it back into the interferometer, as described above.
% Introduction of the SRC also broadens the FHWM of the cavity resonance.
Considering the coupled cavity system (shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:aLIGO_as_coupled_cavities}) in analogy to a system of two coupled harmonic oscillators (e.g.\ two pendulums connected by a spring), changing the length of the SRC (and/or the transmitivity of the ITM) affects the coupling between the cavities (analogous to the energy transfer between the two oscillators). The lowest resonance of the coupled system, known as the coupled cavity pole, is the most sensitive band of the detector. The sensitivity depth and bandwidth of the detector around the pole depend on the parameters of the SRC.


The effect of the length of the SRC on the signal transfer function is shown as red and blue lines in the middle panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:src_transfer_functions}.
For a short SRC, the signal transfer function is constant at frequencies below $10^2$ Hz and then slowly begins to roll off, losing an order of magnitude when it gets to $10$ kHz. For a long SRC (of comparable length to the arm cavity), the signal transfer function is unchanged at lower frequencies, begins to roll-off later than the short SRC around the pole, but has a faster roll off after the pole, losing two orders of magnitude by $10$ kHz. As a result, the long SRC is more sensitive around the coupled cavity pole but has shorter bandwidth overall at higher frequencies than that (see the bottom panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:src_transfer_functions}). This allows the detector to be tuned as to be more sensitive in a given band of frequencies at the cost of being less sensitive at frequencies outside of that band. By accurate modelling of a gravitational wave source and choice of the appropriate parameters of the detector, this should allow for new sources at high frequencies to be detected~\cite{Adya_2020}.


Importantly, the parameters of the SRC (its length and the FWHM of its pole) also affect how internal squeezing reduces the quantum noise, discussed below.

\subsection{Internal squeezing}
\label{sec:internal_squeezing}

Internal squeezing is when a squeezer crystal is placed inside the interferometer, in the SRC as in Figs.~\ref{fig:aLIGO_configuration} and~\ref{fig:aLIGO_as_coupled_cavities}, as opposed to having vacuum fluctuations squeezed externally and injected in via a Faraday isolator (external squeezing). Note that aLIGO currently uses external and not internal squeezing. Since external squeezing is well understood, is the norm in current detectors, and is compatible with internal squeezing~\cite{Adya_2020,Korobko_2019}, it is not necessary to include it to determine the benefits of internal squeezing.
% We do not consider external squeezing further here.


% SRC, signal de-amplification
Here we consider a high frequency (HF) gravitational wave detector motivated in Section~\ref{sec:introduction}. With internal squeezing in the phase quadrature, the quantum phase noise (the shot noise) gets reduced around the coupled cavity pole. The linewidth of the SRC (the FWHM of the cavity resonance, see Section~\ref{sec:basics}) determines the bandwidth of the noise reduction. For the system considered here, this noise reduction is shown in the black and green lines in the top panel Fig.~\ref{fig:src_transfer_functions}.


Squeezing in phase will anti-squeeze in amplitude. In the system considered here, the homodyne angle was chosen to ``select'' the phase quadrature (in convention the readout angle is set to whichever quadrature the most signal is in). If it instead the homodyne angle was changed to select the amplitude quadrature, then the well in the top panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:src_transfer_functions} would be inverted into a bump, but then, since the readout is no longer selecting the quadrature with the most signal, most of the sensitivity would be lost. In any case, the low frequency response does not change from the case without squeezing (since the squeezer only affects the noise and the signal within the linewidth of the SRC).


Because the squeezing is internal, the signal is affected too and is shown, for the system consider here, in the middle panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:src_transfer_functions}. Squeezing in phase results in the signal losing power around the pole (known as de-amplification), but, this is less significant than the noise reduction, and so the sensitivity (as the SNR) overall improves around the pole.
% vacuum input, signal and noise see the interferometer differently
Why internal squeezing affects the noise and the signal differently is best understood through the reduced coupled cavity system, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:aLIGO_as_coupled_cavities}. There, the vacuum and the signal enter the system from different ends (the noise enters into the SRC while the signal is generated in the arm cavity) and so will see the squeezer differently. Moreover, at the output (readout) side of the SRM, the noise consists of a promptly reflected component and a transmitted component from the SRC, which destructively interfere (as described in Section~\ref{sec:basics}) and enhance the effect of the squeezer. The signal, however, only has the transmitted component, so no destructive interference and therefore the asymmetry between the signal and noise.


The goal of the rest of this report is to test internal squeezing in Finesse by considering different detector configurations. However, first, we must test the implementation of the non-linear element (the \code{nle}) as a squeezer.

	\label{fig:squeezed_cavity}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Analytics}

% approximate noise sources/vacuum to just come from ...
To test the non-linear element (\code{nle}), first we consider a squeezed cavity. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:squeezed_cavity}, this consists of a non-linear element inside of a cavity and homodyne readout to detect the squeezed vacuum. A Faraday isolator is included to redirect the squeezed output. We assume that one of the mirrors is fully reflective (therefore the cavity is overcoupled) and that both mirrors are lossless. We assume that only port in the system for vacuum fluctuations to enter through is the input into the cavity. We also assume that the only other noise source in the system is the laser noise in the local oscillator (which will cancel out as usual in balanced homodyne readout).

% leave the actual derivation to an appendix
We derive the analytics for this system, getting an expression for the double-sided power spectral density (PSD) of the homodyne intensity, $S_{\mathrm{HomI}}(\Omega)$, in terms of the parameters of the cavity (the length and tuning, the reflectivity of the input mirror), the squeezer (the squeezer gain and squeezer angle), and the local oscillator (the amplitude and homodyne angle). See Appendix~\ref{app:squeezed_cavity_analytics} for the full derivation and formulae, we use Mathematica~\cite{mathematica} to simplify expressions.


\subsubsection{Threshold}
% threshold results, operating above threshold is not physically meaningful for the approximations made to reach these analytics

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{figures/not_main_PSD_vs_r.pdf}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Homodyne intensity against squeezer parameter for a squeezed cavity. This figure shows the result from derived analytics for the absolute value of the PSD of homodyne intensity, normalised by the value with no squeezing. This figure shows a zero at $r = - 0.0263$ and a pole at $r = 0.0263$, known as the threshold. The behaviour above threshold is not of concern as assumptions made in the analytics break down there and since aLIGO operates well below threshold.}
	\label{fig:not_main_PSD_vs_r}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure*}
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/not_main_PSD_vs_freq.pdf}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Homodyne intensity against angular frequency offset from the carrier for a squeezed cavity. This figure shows a detail of the result from derived analytics for the absolute value of the PSD of homodyne intensity, normalised by the value with no squeezing, for various squeezer parameters. This figure shows resonances with an FSR of $0.94248 \times 10^9$ Hz for the non-zero squeezer parameters. Off resonance, the difference between different squeezer parameters is far smaller, with the difference between positive and negative threshold being less than $1\%$.}
	\label{fig:not_main_PSD_vs_freq}
\end{figure*}

We consider the behaviour at the carrier frequency of the absolute value of the (double-sided) PSD against the squeezer parameter, i.e.\ $\abs{S_{\mathrm{HomI}}(0)}$ against $r$ (alt.\ $r_\mathrm{sqz}$). In particular, for a tuned, $1$ m long cavity, with the input mirror having reflectivity $r_1 = 0.9$, both squeezer and homodyne angle zero (squeezing and readout in the same quadrature), and amplitude $A = 1$ (in suitable units, see derivation) (shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:not_main_PSD_vs_r}). The PSD has a pole at around $r_\mathrm{Thresh} = 0.0263$ (estimated numerically with Mathematica), known as the threshold value for the squeezer. The PSD also has a zero at $r = -r_\mathrm{Thresh}$. As $\abs{r}$ increases past threshold, the PSD limits to the value with no squeezing. Note that a negative squeezer parameter $r$ is equivalent to the squeezer angle changing by $\pi/2$ and the squeezer parameter being $\abs{r}$, i.e.\ squeezing by $\abs{r}$ in the other quadrature.


The explanation for this behaviour lies in the assumptions made in the analytics. In particular, we assumed that the pump laser for the squeezer was an undepletable reservoir. This meant that when we pumped in phase with the noise we could endlessly amplify and we when pumped out of phase we could completely cancel the noise, these two conditions occur exactly when threshold is reached. Physically this is not the case, and pump depletion requires a Hamiltonian model of the system to analyse properly. This means that the analytics derived here break at threshold, similarly, any results above threshold are unphysical.
This could be an issue for modelling, except that the aLIGO squeezer operates normally well below threshold, where the model is accurate reasonably well and so can be used to study aLIGO.


We are also interested in the behaviour at some frequency offset $\Omega$ from the carrier frequency for different squeezer parameters, relative to the frequency behaviour with no squeezing, i.e.\ $\abs{S_{\mathrm{HomI}}(\Omega, r)/S_{\mathrm{HomI}}(\Omega, 0)}$ against $\Omega$ for fixed $r$. We use the same parameters as above and a selection of different squeezer parameters (shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:not_main_PSD_vs_freq}). For all non-zero squeezer parameters, Fig.~\ref{fig:not_main_PSD_vs_freq} shows resonances every $9.42$~(rad)~GHz. When the squeezer is at threshold, at each resonance the PSD becomes unbounded or goes to zero, while off resonance the PSD has a fractional difference on the order of $10^{-3}$ from the case with no squeezing.


\subsection{Testing the non-linear element in Finesse}

	\caption{Homodyne intensity against squeezer parameter for a squeezed cavity. This figure shows the result from a Finesse model for the absolute value of the \code{qhd} readout (which is the ASD of the homodyne intensity), normalised by the value with no squeezing. This figure shows similar behaviour to Fig.~\ref{fig:not_main_PSD_vs_r} with a threshold value of $r = 0.144$. If this threshold value is converted to dB, accounting for differing conventions, then the model and the analytics are found to agree.}
	\label{fig:pykat_relative_qhd_vs_r}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure*}

	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/pykat_relative_qhd_vs_freq.pdf}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Homodyne intensity against angular frequency offset from the carrier for a squeezed cavity. This figure shows a detail of the result from a model in Finesse for the absolute value of the \code{qhd} readout (which is the ASD of the homodyne intensity), normalised by the value with no squeezing, for various different squeezer parameters (in terms of the threshold $r_T = 0.144$) and two different squeezer angles. This figure shows resonances with an FSR of $0.94185 \times 10^9$ Hz for the non-zero squeezer parameters. The behaviour for the different squeezer parameters is similar to Fig.~\ref{fig:not_main_PSD_vs_freq}. This figure also demonstrates that a negative squeezer parameter is equivalent to the positive squeezer parameter but with $\pi/2$ squeezer angle.}
	\label{fig:pykat_relative_qhd_vs_freq}
\end{figure*}

We now model the squeezed cavity in Finesse with the \code{nle} component as the squeezer and \code{qhd} for homodyne readout of the quantum noise. We do this for the same parameters as above and only consider the relative spectral density to avoid worrying about units of amplitude. Note that \code{qhd} calculates amplitude spectral density rather than PSD, which under a logarithm gives a factor of two between them.


% rThresh and \Omega values are the same, convert to dB and check angular freq
The behaviour of the relative homodyne intensity against the squeezer parameter is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:pykat_relative_qhd_vs_r}. The shape of the response is similar to the analytics. The squeezer parameter axis shows the input to the \code{nle} which is in ``dB'' calculated as $r_{\mathrm{nle}} = 10 \log_{10}(e^{r_\mathrm{sqz}})$. The Finesse model agrees on the threshold value with the analytics, as long as the dB convention is accounted for. That is, the Finesse model reaches threshold at $0.114 \approx 10 \log_{10}(e^{0.0263})$ (recall that the analytics reaches threshold at $0.0263$).


% FSR is 1.5 since L = 1
The behaviour against the frequency offset is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:pykat_relative_qhd_vs_freq}. Again, the shape of the response is similar to the analytics.
The angular FSR ($2 \pi \mathrm{FSR}$) for the model is (up to numerical error) $0.94185 \times 10^9$~(rad)~Hz.
The angular FSR in the analytics is $0.94248 \times 10^9$~(rad)~Hz.
The theoretical value for $L = 1$ m is $2 \pi \mathrm{FSR} = 2 \pi c/(2 L) \approx 0.94183 \times 10^9$~(rad)~Hz.
Therefore, the fractional error between the model and the analytics is on the order of $10^{-4}$, calculated as
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{fractional\; error} = \abs{\frac{\mathrm{model} - \mathrm{analytics}}{\mathrm{analytics}}}.
\end{equation}
The fractional error between the model and the theoretical value is on the order of $10^{-6}$. In either case, the agreement is good enough to rely on the Finesse model.
The behaviour of the model against frequency for different squeezer parameters is also similar to the analytics.


Overall, the \code{nle} component models successfully the squeezed cavity, with consideration for the particular definition of dB used. Having passed this test, we now want to test the implementation in a gravitational wave detector, with the ultimate goal to then predict the behaviour of proposed designs involving internal squeezing.


\section{Modelling advanced gravitational wave detector configurations}
\label{sec:aLIGOcomparison}

\subsection{Analytics for the reduced aLIGO configuration}

% get source from Vaishali
We use analytics for the coupled cavity system (shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:aLIGO_as_coupled_cavities}) derived in Refs.~\cite{Korobko_2019,SOMIYA2016521}. Recall that this system is an approximation (albeit a good one) of the simplified aLIGO configuration (shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:aLIGO_configuration}). Also, the input/output relation and the calculation of the coupled cavity pole are both approximate. We claim (tentatively) below that these approximations are responsible for the remaining discrepancy between the analytics and the Finesse model, after correcting first for the conventions of the implementation in Finesse.

	\label{fig:sqz_aLIGO_analytics_v_simulation}
\end{figure*}

We model the simplified, lossless aLIGO configuration (shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:aLIGO_configuration}) in Finesse with internal squeezing in a long SRC, using the \code{nle} component. Internal squeezing configurations with lengths of the SRC of 53~m and 2~km generate the quantum noise at the output, the signal transfer function, and the sensitivity shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:src_transfer_functions}. A summary of some of the parameters used here is shown in Table~\ref{tab:aLIGO_parameters}. Note that the squeezer in the analytics takes the $r_\mathrm{sqz} = 0.06$ parameter as input while the \code{nle} takes the gain in “dB” ($10 \log_{10}(e^\mathrm{sqz})$) as input. Due to another factor of two, however, here we input only $5 \log_{10}(e^\mathrm{sqz})$ into the Finesse model, explained below.


It is worth briefly explaining how we made sure that the Finesse model was simulating the same system as the reduced configuration in the analytics, i.e.\ how we got the parameters in Table~\ref{tab:aLIGO_parameters} to agree. Firstly, we checked that the model was acting as an interferometer. At one stage the beamsplitter was oriented incorrectly and needed to be corrected. Then, we tuned the interferometer to have the operating point at the dark fringe, i.e.\ we made sure no power from the main laser was at the output of the beamsplitter. Finally, we matched the power in the arms between the model and the analytics by removing all losses, matching the mirror transmissivities, and setting the same power on the beamsplitter by making the power recycling mirror transparent and setting the input laser power to match.


% comparison for long SRC with internal squeezing
A comparison of the quantum noise limited sensitivity of the analytics and Finesse is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:sqz_aLIGO_analytics_v_simulation}. With the squeezer turned off, the agreement is nearly exact (to numerical error). With the squeezer turned on, the sensitivity is similar between the analytics and the Finesse model, with an average fractional error of $5\%$.
This remaining error we attribute tentatively to the approximations made in the analytics, in particular the calculation of the coupled cavity pole, although this requires further investigation. However, even if the error is, in fact, in the Finesse model, this error is small enough for the predictions made using the model to be useful in determining the optimal detector configuration.


\subsubsection{Explaining the factor of four discrepancy in dB}

% different def of dB gives a factor of 2
To recap, the squeezer in the analytics takes $r_\mathrm{sqz}$ as input and produces a gain in dB calculated as $20 \log_{10}(e^\mathrm{sqz})$. In Finesse, the \code{nle} components takes a gain value as input but calculates “dB” as only $10 \log_{10}(e^\mathrm{sqz})$, therefore producing twice the amount of squeezing than expected (shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:testing_Finesse_squeezers}). This means that given the $r_\mathrm{sqz} = 0.06$ input into the analytics, we need to halve the gain to account for the difference in definitions in dB, and input $10 \log_{10}(e^\mathrm{sqz})$ into the \code{nle}.


% double passing of NLE gives another factor of 2
As seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:sqz_aLIGO_analytics_v_simulation}, however, the correct value to pass to the \code{nle} is $5 \log_{10}(e^\mathrm{sqz})$, so where is the second factor of two? As mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:squeezing}, physical squeezer crystals are directional, meaning that they will only squeeze states incident from one side (and travelling in the direction of the pump laser), letting those states incident from the other through unchanged. The implementation of the \code{nle} is, however, directionless, meaning that it squeezes from both sides. When placed in a high finesse cavity, it produces twice the amount of squeezing than expected. Therefore, given a squeezer parameter (not in dB), the gain in dB to pass to the \code{nle} is half as small due to different definitions of dB and half as small again due to the directionlessness of the component. This second factor of two was not present in the squeezed cavity results because there the analytics assumed that the squeezer was directionless.


% Is the recommendation to Daniel Brown to both fix the dB and perhaps make nle a directional component (will squeeze light from n1 to n2, but will just let light through n2 to n1)?
Overall, the \code{nle} component successfully models the simplified aLIGO configuration up some error likely due to approximations in the analytics, with the caveat that the gain input must be corrected to account for the nature of the implementation. This is a good result and resolves, positively, the testing of the \code{nle} component that we set out to do. For the sake of consistency, we recommend that the \code{nle} component be modified to calculate the gain as $20 \log_{10}(e^\mathrm{sqz})$ and be possibly made directional as well.


\subsection{Optimisation}

\end{figure*}

% reason to use python is to optimise
Having shown successfully that Finesse can model the aLIGO configuration, we now use PyKat (the Python wrapper to Finesse) to optimise the sensitivity in some band against some given parameters. Here we only do this briefly as a demonstration.


We optimise the quantum noise limited sensitivity within a high frequency band of 900 Hz to 3 kHz for fixed lengths of SRC of 53 m and 2 km, the results are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:aLIGO_optimum_sensitivity_comparison}. This band was chosen to represent a detector tuned to a source in the low kHz region like the binary merger of two neutron stars. The optimisation was allowed to vary the squeezer gain, the squeezer angle, and the homodyne angle. Once again, the results show the high peak and short bandwidth of the long SRC which achieves a peak sensitivity of $1.36 \times 10^{-25}\; 1/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$. It achieves this at a non-zero squeezer angle of $0.014^\circ$, which is surprising and not yet understood (although it could likely just be the optimisation routine getting stuck in a local minimum). Allowing the optimisation to vary additionally the length of the SRC, the power transmission of the SRM, and the tuning of the SRM led to the optimisation getting stuck near the various initial values given, for reasons not yet understood.

\section{Future work}
\label{sec:future_work}

We have shown that Finesse can model successfully internal squeezing in a long signal recycling cavity (SRC) and can support the hypothesis that that configuration improves the high frequency quantum noise limited sensitivity around the coupled cavity pole. Here we detail other proposed configurations and how Finesse could be used to evaluate their efficacy.


% optimisation
Fixing the many parameter optimisation in Section~\ref{sec:optimisation} would improve Finesse’s usefulness in designing the configuration to achieve the best sensitivity in the desired band. Potential fixes to getting stuck in local minima would be to test many different initial conditions in some efficient way or constrain the problem more in some way. Alternatively, the present cost function (which is “maximise the peak quantum noise SNR in a given band”) could be replaced by some other choice in the literature, such as Eq.~1 in Ref.~\cite{Miao_2014} (which measures the improvement in a log-log scale integrated over the detection band against the reference of the baseline design of aLIGO) or Eq.~8 in Ref.~\cite{Martynov_2019} (which integrates the reciprocal of the noise over the band and accounts for the antenna response of the detector). These alternatives may have fewer local minima (making them easier to optimise) and/or be more useful to detector design.


% losses
We have ignored losses to simplify these initial tests, however, losses should be included in any realistic model and are relevant to quantum noise. The complication with introducing a loss is that it then acts as a port for vacuum fluctuations, the coupling of which needs to then be included in the analytics. Finesse handles this complication itself and so introducing realistic losses into the model would be easy, albeit more difficult to derive the analytics to compare to.


% other noise sources
One may be also interested in including control systems or other noise sources than quantum noise in the model. Although Finesse can handle both of these, they are as not relevant to the work here and can be handled separately.
% Similarly, we have focussed on quantum noise here because it limits the high frequency sensitivity of current detectors. A more realistic model would include other sorts of noise sources along with control systems. Finesse can handle control signals and so they could be added in. Finesse can handle other noise sources, up to the limitations of the model in how the noise can affect the components.
% Either the modelling would need to ignore those noise sources or some cleverness with injecting suitable sidebands would be required.


% detuned long SRC, non-degenerate squeezing
As for investigating different proposed configurations: two changes would be detuning the long SRC and non-degenerate squeezing. Detuning should allow for more control of the bandwidth of the detector and so allow for more sources to be seen.
Detuning the long SRC is something we started to investigate by allowing the optimisation routine to change the tuning of the SRM; investigating this further would amount to fixing the optimisation as above.
Non-degenerate squeezing is when the produced entangled photons from the squeezer, the signal and the idler, are at different frequencies and so see the interferometer differently. This would require the addition of a new non-degenerate squeezer component to Finesse similar to the \code{nle}. The motivation for internal non-degenerate squeezing is to be able to replace a ``white-light cavity'' (WLC) with a different configuration that has the same broadband improvement but without the WLC’s complications of stability, high mechanical quality factor, and low required thermal noise~\cite{white-light-resonators}.


% other limitations of finesse in its current form that can be overcome?


\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}
% can be quite short!
% do not need to explain details or tell a story
% just report on what you have done and why people should care

% sqz cavity, derived analytics
We have shown that the newly implemented non-linear element (\code{nle}) in Finesse successfully models a squeezer in a cavity when compared to analytics that we derived.
% aLIGO, recommendation
We also tested the \code{nle} by modelling it inside of the long signal recycling cavity of a simplified configuration of aLIGO. Its behaviour agreed with existing analytics up to a $5\%$ fractional error, which we believe to be due to approximations made in the analytics. This, however, requires further investigation. These results required consideration for the convention of decibels used and the directionlessness of the \code{nle}. For the sake of consistency, we recommend that the \code{nle} component be changed to: (1) calculate dB as $20 \log_{10}$ and (2) be made directional.

% optimisation
Furthermore, assuming that the \code{nle} is working correctly, we have optimised the high frequency peak quantum noise limited sensitivity by varying the squeezer and SRC parameters. Although this work is ongoing, we have already demonstrated how Finesse can be used to find optimum detector configurations. All of this and more future work, such as modelling exotic configurations, is now possible since we can trust the \code{nle} component that has passed all of our tests.

% remotivate
Using a non-linear element inside the signal recycling cavity of a gravitational wave detector has been proposed to increase the high frequency (kHz) quantum noise limited sensitivity without affecting the low frequency sensitivity. We have demonstrated support for this hypothesis. At high frequencies are sources, like the late states of binary neutron star-neutron star mergers, that current detectors are too limited by quantum noise to see. Therefore, being able to model such configurations, in the hope to be able to see these new sources, is of great interest to the field of gravitational wave research.

\section{Squeezed cavity analytics}
\label{app:squeezed_cavity_analytics}

We want to derive the PSD of the homodyne intensity, $S_{\mathrm{HomI}}(\Omega)$, for the squeezed cavity (shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:squeezed_cavity}). We proceed in four steps:
\begin{itemize}
\item finding the transfer matrix for an empty cavity in the frequency domain
\item borrowing that solution for a squeezed cavity to arrive at the quadratures at the photodiodes
\item computing the Fourier spectrum of the time average of the intensity
\item using properties of the quantum noise quadratures from Ref.~\cite{Danilishin_2012} to arrive at the result
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Derivation}

\subsubsection{Transfer matrix for a cavity}

% fix position of this figure later
\begin{figure}[ht]
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{figures/empty_cavity_amplitudes.pdf}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Labelled electric field amplitudes for an empty Fabry-Perot cavity. These amplitudes are used in deriving the matrix solution for the reflected field $a_5$ in terms of the incident field $a_0$.}
	\label{fig:empty_cavity_amplitudes}
\end{figure}

Consider an empty two-mirror cavity with reflectivities $r_1, r_2$ and transmitivities $t_1, t_2$ (shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:empty_cavity_amplitudes}). For simplicity, we assume that the front mirror is lossless and that the back mirror is perfectly reflective $r_2 = 1, t_2 = 0$. Light $a_0(\Omega)$ is incident on the front mirror, where $a_0$ is a vector of the quadratures in the frequency domain (see Section~\ref{sec:squeezing}). Let $a_j$ for $j = 1, \ldots, 6$ be similar and defined as in Fig.~\ref{fig:empty_cavity_amplitudes}. We use the mirror phase convention of no change on transmission and reflection from one of the sides and $\pi$ on reflection from the other side. The transmission and reflection matrices are therefore $R_i = r_i I,\; T_i = t_i I$, where $i = 1, 2$ and $I$ is the $2 \times 2$ identity matrix. Let the propagation matrix from one mirror to the other be $P$, which we construct later. Therefore, the amplitudes are related by
\begin{align}
a_1 &= T_1 a_0 + R_1 a_4\\
a_2 &= P a_1\nonumber\\
a_3 &= R_2 a_2 \nonumber\\
a_4 &= P a_3\nonumber\\
a_5 &= T_1 a_4 - R_1 a_0\nonumber\\
a_6 &= T_2 a_2\nonumber
\end{align}
Solving the set of equations
\begin{align}
a_4 &= P R_2 P (T_1 a_0 + R_1 a_4) \\
a_4 &= (I - P R_2 P R_1)^{-1} P R_2 P T_1 a_0 \nonumber\\
a_5 &= \left(T_1 (I - P R_2 P R_1)^{-1} P R_2 P T_1 - R_1\right) a_0
\label{eq:empty_cav_refl}
\end{align}
We get an expression for the reflected field off the cavity, $a_5$.


The propagation matrix $P$ across free space depends on the macroscopic length $L$ and tuning $\delta$ of the space. Let the cavity be of length $D = L + \delta l$. Then the propagation across free space is
\begin{align}
P(L, \delta l) &= \exp\left(i\frac{\Omega (L + \delta l)}{c}\right) \;\mathrm{Rot}\left(\frac{\omega_0 \delta l}{c}\right) \\
\mathrm{Rot}(\phi) &= \begin{bmatrix}
\cos(\phi) & -\sin(\phi)\\ 
\sin(\phi) & \cos(\phi)\nonumber
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
We assume that $\Omega \ll \omega_0$ and so $\frac{\Omega \delta l}{c} \ll 1$. Let the angular tuning be $\psi = \frac{\omega_0 \delta l}{c}$. Therefore
\begin{equation}
P(L, \delta l) = \exp\left(i\frac{\Omega L}{c}\right) \;\mathrm{Rot}\left(\psi\right)
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Quadratures at the photodiodes}

To incorporate the squeezer, we borrow the above solution but change the propagation matrix to
\begin{align}
	\begin{gathered}
	\tilde{P}(L, \delta l, r, \phi) = P\left(\frac{L}{2}, \frac{\delta l}{2}\right) \mathrm{Sqz}(r, \phi) P\left(\frac{L}{2}, \frac{\delta l}{2}\right) \\
	\mathrm{Sqz}(r, \phi) =\\
	\begin{bmatrix}
	\cos(2 \phi) \sinh(r) + \cosh(r) & \sin(2\phi) \sinh(r)\\ 
	\sin(2\phi) \sinh(r) & -\cos(2 \phi) \sinh(r) + \cosh(r)
	\end{bmatrix}
	\end{gathered}
\end{align}
Where $r = r_\mathrm{sqz}$ is the squeezer parameter (not in dB), $\phi$ is the squeezer angle, and $\mathrm{Sqz}$ is the squeezer matrix mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:squeezing}. Note that this substitution of $\tilde{P}$ for $P$ everywhere means that the light gets squeezed from both directions by the squeezer. This is not what physically happens but is how the \code{nle} is implemented, so for ease of comparison we choose this convention. Note that this is different to the directional squeezer in the analytics in Section~\ref{sec:aLIGOcomparison}.


Referring to Fig.~\ref{fig:squeezed_cavity}, let $n = a_0$ be the vacuum incident on the cavity, $a$ be the laser noise, and the local oscillator be
\begin{equation}
A = A_0 \begin{bmatrix}
\cos(\theta)\\ 
\sin(\theta)
\end{bmatrix},
\end{equation}
for homodyne angle $\theta$ and amplitude $A_0$. By Eq.~\ref{eq:empty_cav_refl}, the field reflected off the cavity is
\begin{equation}
n_r = \left(t_1 (I - r_1 \tilde{P}^2)^{-1} \tilde{P}^2 t_1 - r_1 \right) n
\end{equation}


For a 50/50 beamsplitter and negligible propagation lengths outside the cavity the fields at the two photodiodes are therefore
\begin{align}
b_1 &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( n_r + A + a\right) \\
b_2 &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( n_r - A - a\right)\nonumber
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Fourier spectrum of the time average of the intensity}

Consider the time average (notated as $\expect{\cdot}$) of the intensity at the first photodiode $\expect{\tilde{I}_1(t)}$. Let tilde ($\tilde{\cdot}$) denote time domain quantities. The above fields are in the frequency domain, so we need to take the inverse Fourier transform. Note that depending on the quadrature convention there may need to be a constant squared out the front of the intensity to fix the units (but we later drop this constant anyway so I will not write it). 
\begin{align}
\tilde{b}_1 &= \begin{bmatrix}
\tilde{b}_{1,c}\\ 
\tilde{b}_{1,s}
\end{bmatrix} \\
\expect{\tilde{I}_1(t)} &= \expect{\abs{\tilde{b}_{1,c} \cos(\omega_0 t) + \tilde{b}_{1,s} \sin(\omega_0 t)}^2}
\end{align}
We assume that the time domain quadratures are Hermitian and that the quadratures are slowly changing with respect to $\omega_0$. Taking time averages (and noting that $\expect{\cos(\omega_0 t) \sin(\omega_0 t)} = 0$ and $\expect{\cos^2} = \expect{\sin^2} = \frac{1}{2}$) this leaves

\begin{equation}
\expect{\tilde{I}_1} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \tilde{b}_{1,c}^2 + \tilde{b}_{1,s}^2 \right)
\end{equation}


We then split the quadratures $\tilde{b}_i$ into a constant $B$ and a time varying part $\tilde{b}'$ with average zero. Assuming that the time varying part is small with respect to the constant part (this is true for the noise compared to the local oscillator), we expand the quadratures squared and drop the terms quadratic in the time varying parts.
\begin{equation}
\expect{\tilde{I}_1} = \frac{1}{2} \left( B_{1,c}^2 + B_{1,s}^2 + 2 \left( B_{1,c} \tilde{b}_{1,c}' + B_{1,s} \tilde{b}_{1,s}' \right) \right)
\end{equation}


Taking Fourier transform to return to the frequency domain, and dropping the constant (DC) term since we are only interested in the quantum noise.
\begin{equation}
\expect{I_1} = B_{1,c} b_{1,c}' + B_{1,s} b_{1,s}'
\end{equation}
Where, since the tildes indicated the time domain, we just drop them to return to the frequency domain.

We claim that these $B$ and $b'$ are the constant and frequency dependant parts of the original quadrature $b$. This amounts to $B$ being the local oscillator, e.g.\ $B_{1,c} = 1/\sqrt{2} A_0 \cos(\theta)$, and $b'$ being the noise terms in $b$, i.e.\ $1/\sqrt{2} (n_r \pm a)$. The homodyne intensity, $\mathrm{HomI}$, is then
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{HomI} = \expect{I_1 - I_2} = B_{1,c} b_{1,c}' + B_{1,s} b_{1,s}' - B_{2,c} b_{2,c}' - B_{2,s} b_{2,s}'
\end{equation}


Substituting the quadratures at the photodiodes and simplifying reveals that the balanced homodyne intensity does not depend on $a$, the laser noise of the local oscillator, as expected. Let $n_c$ and $n_s$ be the quadratures of the original vacuum input $n$.
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{HomI} = \frac{A_0(g_1 n_c + g_2 n_s)}{g_3}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{PSD of the homodyne intensity}

Recall the definition of the double-sided PSD from Section~\ref{sec:squeezing}.
\begin{equation}
S_\mathrm{HomI}(\Omega) 2 \pi \delta(\Omega - \Omega') = \langle0| \mathrm{HomI}(\Omega) \circ \mathrm{HomI}^\dagger(\Omega') |0\rangle
\end{equation}
Note that $S,\; \mathrm{HomI}$ and $n$ should all have hats (\,$\hat{}$\,) to denote operators (but we drop them to reduce clutter).

Assuming that the homodyne intensity is Hermitian, and expanding out the symmetric products we get
\begin{align}
S_\mathrm{HomI}(\Omega) 2 \pi \delta(\Omega - \Omega') &= \frac{A_0^2}{g_3(\Omega) g_3(\Omega')} \\
&\cdot \langle0| g_1(\Omega) g_1(\Omega') (n_c(\Omega) \circ n_c(\Omega'))\nonumber\\
&+ g_2(\Omega) g_2(\Omega') (n_s(\Omega) \circ n_s(\Omega')) \nonumber\\
&+ g_1(\Omega) g_2(\Omega') (n_c(\Omega) \circ n_s(\Omega'))\nonumber \\
&+ g_2(\Omega) g_1(\Omega') (n_s(\Omega) \circ n_c(\Omega')) |0\rangle\nonumber
\end{align}


From pg.~38 of Ref.~\cite{Danilishin_2012}, for the quantum noise we have the following relations (the factor of $\frac{1}{2}$ is from the choice of using a double-sided PSD).
\begin{align}
\langle0|n_c(\Omega) \circ n_c(\Omega')|0\rangle &= \frac{1}{2} 2 \pi \delta(\Omega - \Omega') \\
\langle0|n_s(\Omega) \circ n_s(\Omega')|0\rangle &= \frac{1}{2} 2 \pi \delta(\Omega - \Omega') \nonumber\\
\langle0|n_c(\Omega) \circ n_s(\Omega')|0\rangle &= 0\nonumber
\end{align}

Substituting these relations in we arrive at the result, the PSD of the homodyne intensity. For plotting purposes we set $A_0 = 1$.
\begin{equation}
S_\mathrm{HomI}(\Omega) = \frac{A_0^2 \left( g_1(\Omega)^2 + g_2(\Omega)^2 \right)}{g_3(\Omega)^2}
\end{equation}
